  <h3>LESSON 2: INTERNET BROWSERS</h3>
  </center>
    
  <h3> Identifying Browsers</h3>  
    <p><i>An internet Browsers, Also known as a web browser as simply a browser, is a software program that lets you view web pages on your computer.</p></i>
  <p><i>The main purpose of an internet browser is to translate the code that computer use to creat websites into the next,graphic, and other features of the web pages that were used to seeing today.</p></i>
  <h3> The first web browser</h3>
  <p><i> The first web browser was called World Wide Web; later it changes its name to Nexus. Created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, it gave people a basic way to view web page. However, It was a long way from the immersive online experience we have today.</p></i>
  <p><i> Without graphical browsers, the internet as we know it today would not be possible. In the 90s the internet was text-based, bland, and couldnt be used without some fairly significant technical knowledge. This limited the number of people who had the interest and the ability to use the internet. 
  </p></i>
  <p><i>In the early 90s, the audiens was so small and niche that most companies didnt have an online presence. Shopping giants like eBay and Amazon would never have had a chance of drawing a decent crowd.</p></i>

  <h3> That started to change with the introduction of Mosaic in 1992.</h3>
  <p><i>The Mosaic browser helped make the internet ubiquitoss. The graphical interface made navigating the web easy to understand and the ability to display graphics on websites made web pages more interesting. Best off all, people no longer needed so be programmers to enjoy themeselves online.</p></i>
  <p><i>With more people spending more time on the internet, companies 
were quick to follow. E-commerce, online sweepstakes, social media, 
and many other things we take for granted today followed closely on 
the heels of the first graphical browsers.
</p></i>
  <h3>Modern Internet Browsers</h3>
  <p><i></i>Internet browsers have developed into powerful tools that let 
you safely and quickly access your favorite websites.
</p></i>
  <p><i>Modern internet browsers have many helpful features. Tabbed 
browsing, for example, lets you open up many web pages in individual 
tabs, instead of needing a resource-intensive separate window for 
each page. This is very helpful if you want to enter sweepstakes 
faster. Modern browsers offer security features, embedded video, 
nigh-instant loading times, and many other things that make the net 
such a fun place to spend time
<p>Which Internet Browsers Are Available Today?</p>
  <h3>Most browsers are available for free download. The six most popular internet 
browsers today include:
</h3>
  <p><i>1. Mozilla Firefox</p></i>
  <p><i>2. Google Chrome</p>
</i>
  <p><i>3. Microsoft Edge (formerly Internet Explorer)</p></i>
  <p><i>4. Apple Safari</p></i>
    <p><i>5. Opera
</p></i>
      <p><i>6. Brave
</p></i>
  <h3>How Internet Browsers Work:</h3>
  <p><i>1. You type a website's URL into your browser's address bar; 
"http://www.dotdash.com" is an example of a URL.</p></i>
  <p>2. The browser locates and requests that page's information from a web 
server.</p>
<p>3. The browser receives a file written in computer code, like HTML or 
Javascript, which includes instructions about how to display the 
information on that page.</p>
<p>4. The browser interprets that file and displays the page for you to read 
and interact with. And it does all of this in just a few seconds, 
usually.</p>
  <p>The important thing to know is that different browsers have slightly 
different ways of working so that if you are having trouble getting pages 
to display or sweepstakes to load on one browser, it makes sense to try 
another. Install two or three of your favorite browsers and switch between 
them if you're having trouble seeing a website properly.</p>
  <h3>Basics Browser Tools</h3>
  
  <p> 1. Hyperlinks - A hyperlink is an element in an HTML document that links 
to either another portion of the document or to another document 
altogether. On webpages, hyperlinks are usually colored purple or blue 
and are sometimes underlined.</p>
    <p>2. Bonus Tools – it's a tools extra tools or extra setting of a browsers</p>
<p>Example: Browsers VPN, Extension, History Logs and etc.</p>
    <p>3. World Wide Web - also known as the web
Refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access 
on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These 
pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that 
users click on for information. This information can be in different 
formats, including text, images, audio and video.</p>
<h4>How does the World Wide Web work?</h4>
<p>Paving the way for an internet revolution that has transformed the 
world in only three decades, the World Wide Web consists of multiple 
components that enable users to access various resources, documents and web 
pages on the internet. Thus, the WWW is like a vast electronic book whose 
pages are stored or hosted on different servers worldwide.
</p>
<p>These pages are the primary component or building blocks of the WWW 
and are linked through hyperlinks, which provide access from one specific 
spot in a hypertext or hypermedia document to another spot within that 
document or a different one. Hyperlinks are another defining concept of the 
WWW and provide its identity as a collection of interconnected documents.
</p>
<h4>Hypertext</h4>
<p>is a method for instant information cross-referencing that 
supports communications on the web. Hypertext makes it easy to link content 
on one web page to content on another web page or site. Hypertext and HTTP 
enable people to access the millions of websites active on the WWW.</p>

 <h3>LESSON 4: DATA AND COSTUMER RIGHTS</h3>
   </center>
  <p> Data refers to raw facts,   figures, or information typically stored and processed by computersystems. It can encompass a wide range of types, including text, numbers, images, audio, videos and more. In the context of modern technology and digital systems, data is often collected,
